        <h2 id="pre-interactivos">Pre-Interactivos?</h2>
<p>Arrived at <em>Serrinha</em> via GIG, picked up by Hernâni at <em>Rodoviário Novo Rio</em> then Meire at <em>Resende</em>. The number of new people and language is overwheleming. Still trying to adjust to timezone and the fact that I’m in Brasil. Thiago has a new haircut. I saw a hummingbird. Massa.</p>

<h2 id="dia-1---domingo">Dia 1 - Domingo</h2>
<p>Misty and cold today, everything slightly blurry and can’t see mountain range in the background. There is a giant stone pool that will never fill up, decorated with upturned PET bottles.</p>

<p>Went through presentations of the projects, and people this morning. Radamés translated the projects beforehand but, only had an idea from the title and short discription - in short not much. Now getting an idea of what everyone else wants to do. Am amazed at how <strong>right on</strong> everyone is.</p>

<p>Am eternally grateful to Lirca for being my babblefish. I must send her lots of interesting chutneys later. But actaully everyone is being amazingly accomidating, and they take turns making sure I know what’s going on. The communal meals are nice opportunities to talk and get to know the others in a relaxed setting. It’s been awhile since I’ve been in an situation where I don’t understand what’s going on. I’m not as bothered about it as I used to be, even though I can tell I’m missing lots of jokes and will have stilted conversations.</p>

<p>Have wonderful colloborators. Saulo studies limnology. Sabrina is a (radical?) writer. Aline is a recent graduate of architecture and a river project. We played the Wray Castle game in the other house. Sabrina won, but we got to see her play air trumpet so that’s okay.</p>

<h2 id="dia-2---segunda">Dia 2 - Segunda</h2>
<p>We have a flipchart. Things were written on it. Have a vauge idea of creating a game around Serrinha, looking at the part/current/future through the medium of a text adventure game. Am facinated with the idea that what was once a coffee plantation is now a APA. There are people living here, which will stress the land. Water is not managed very well…</p>

<p>We have a list of people to talk to.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Felipe: Tuesday afternoon</li>
  <li>Juçai factory</li>
  <li>Trutas : Wed is public holiday…</li>
  <li>Simonea &amp; Donna Gloria AKA living libraries</li>
  <li>Micro-brewery…</li>
  <li>Meire : get number for juçai factory &amp; living libraries</li>
  <li>Local people from bar and camp site.</li>
  <li>Saulo found a paper about Serrinha from 2008 and he will FB the undergraduate tomorrow.</li>
  <li>Vegan chefs</li>
</ol>

<p>Went for a walk to find Rio Pomo, thought we could find the source. Found some crazy hoses instead. Felipe says it’s pretty out of control.</p>

<p>Alina &amp; Sabrina are checking out the local bar.</p>
